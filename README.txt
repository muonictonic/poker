Brian Gillespie - poker

Last Update: 9/3/2013

    To play: With all .py files in the same directory, just run main.py

    Just a simple poker game. A deck is built and shuffled and hands are dealt.
    The number of computer players is chosen by the user before each round.
    Each hand has five cards and each type of hand is worth a certain number of
    points. These points are compared to select a winner. The user is prompted
    tokeep playing at the end of each round.

In construction:

    Still working on a lot of things. So a lot of the functions are still
    pretty rough. Also comments are missing from a lot of areas. I'm also
    planning to allow the user to see the other hands after each game, and
    possibly adding the ability to discard and draw new cards before the game
    is decided.
